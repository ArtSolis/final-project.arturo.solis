## Binary to Decimal

Binary to Decimal Conversion is the process of converting binary numbers, which consist of 0s and 1s, into decimal numbers, which are base 10. This conversion is essential in computer science for interpreting binary data into human-readable formats.
The binary value can be converted to decimal, the total of 8 bits in a byte can hold a value if it is on or off. If all of the bits were on (in the 1 position) the total value would be 255. 
Binary numbers can represent letters and characters. Standard ASCII charts can provide the decoded values without the need to manually covert them. It is important to understand that binary is one of the core encoding types, and knowing how to convert manually can help with validation.


## Binary to Hex to Decimal

We generally use the base10 (also known as decimal) numbering system, which uses 10 values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) to represent numbers.
Computers use the base2 (also known as binary) numbering system to represent data. The binary numbering system uses two values, 0 and 1, to represent numbers. This is because a computer only recognizes two states: the presence or absence of an electrical charge. Even if a computer is showing you decimal numbers, it is merely a translation of the binary numbers inside the machine. A single binary digit (0 or 1) is called a bit. The term octet is used to describe a unit of 8 bits. Most modern computers also have 8 bits in a byte. In the early days of computers, the word byte was also used to describe other quantities of bits. The term nibble is equal to half a byte and is therefore 4 bits, in most cases.
Hexadecimal is base16 and therefore uses 16 values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F) to represent numbers. The hexadecimal system is useful because a byte (8 bits) of binary data can be represented using just two hexadecimal digits. This makes it easier for humans to read or write large numbers in hexadecimal rather than binary format.
