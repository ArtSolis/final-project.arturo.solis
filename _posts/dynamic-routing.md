The Binary Number System uses two digits, 0 and 1, and is the foundation for all modern computing. The word binary is derived from the word “bi” which means two. But what makes it so essential, and how does it work?
The base-2 numeral system, also known as the binary system, is a way of representing numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit is called a "bit," short for "binary digit." This system is widely used in modern computers and electronic devices because it is simple to implement with logic gates in digital circuits. The binary system is preferred over other methods of communication because it is easy to work with and more resistant to errors in physical implementations.

The binary numeric system is essentially the only language computers can understand, because of the association/comparation with electricity. 0 is associated with Low voltage, and 1 is associated with High voltage, or even more simple 0 = Off, 1 = Onn. The binary system is also better avoiding errors, compared to systems with more digits, binary's simplicity ensures greater reliability in noisy or unstable environments.
